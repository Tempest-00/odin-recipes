This is a the recipes project, part of the Odin Project Curriculum for HTML5. 

The intention of the project is create a barebones html page with links to different recipes. The page is not intended to have a good appearance, but purely focused on functionality. 

I chose an easy chicken pot pie recipe.

Also decided to put in my own homemade recipes, be sure to give them a try!

Upon completion of the assignment, I hadn't gone to much further than what I was already familiar with, but it was helpful to brush up on the basics of making a skeleton of a page before necessarily brushing it up.
